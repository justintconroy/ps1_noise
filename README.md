Noise-O-Tron

A small, cheap (~$5/piece if you build 100 at a time) optical theremin that can be assembled with no soldering.

The idea is to fabricate a custom perfboard from acrylic, heavy cardstock or other suitable material.
Components are pushed through the top of this perfboard and the leads are twisted together to form a circuit.

I've been using laser-cut acrylic, but anything from CNC routing to an inkjet printer should be sufficient (I think heavy cardstock + hole punch would be very cool)

Laser Cutting
=========

In the root of this project there are two PDF files - ten_boards.pdf and thirty_boards.pdf - these are exported from inkscape with vector lines 0.001" in width. I use these files on an Epilog machine - you may need to generate your own for other print driver-based machines.


Assembly
=========

The first challenge to overcome with this device is the fact that DIP packages have very short legs. In the first round of noisemakers I made, we soldered extensions cut from solid-core wire onto the 5 pins used. This sucked.

---

For the second go, we're using pin headers from Samtec, and trimming off the 3 unused pins. These are a little harder to twist together than the solid-core wire legs, but should be significantly faster to prepare for the event.

The Samtec headers listed in the BOM have sufficiently long legs, and are the correct size - they do, however, have a little trouble holding onto ICs. For the latest batch, we hot glued the headers onto the microcontrollers once the latter were programmed.

---

The very latest iteration is using a wire-wrap DIP socket (see BOM) that works very well. Trim the 3 unused pins and away you go.

ToDo
=========

1. Create info card
    * Page with information on 'how to' noisemaker 
    * github link
    * cost per unit
    * getting materials
    * required prep work
    * hand these mofos out at every event to get other people using the noisemaker
2. Create assembly photo series
    * Just a photo of each step - to live in the repo to simplify assembly for others using the project
