Each noisemaker will also require:

2x M2 screws, long enough to reach through your board material (I used 3/8" screws for 1/8" acrylic)  
*Available from Digikey in multiples of 100 - H739-ND*  
2x M2 nuts  
*Available from Digikey in multiples of 100 - H761-ND*

I used 1/8 inch acrylic for the boards. Any reasonably stiff material will work (I'd like to see an implementation cut from card stock and 'drilled' with a hole punch). I found that transparent colors of acrylic
work *much* better than opaque - being able to see the board art from both sides is very useful.
